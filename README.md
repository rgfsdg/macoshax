so youve got your brand new macbook pld from sst. what now? well i havent got much tutorials yet but this is my first one.
# admin. this wont work if ur recovery is locked  (for ventura and below)
so u want admin but the school and parents dont allow you. well screw them. this is how u get admin access:
step 1: power off your macbook
step 2: press and hold your power button. a text appears (loading startup options)
step 3: press and hold your power button until the options come up.
step 4: select options and you should see the apple logo with the spinning beachball
step 5: once the macos recovery loads click utilities in the toolbar and press terminal.
step 6: here comes the hard part: type ```cd /volumes``` then ```cd macintosh\ hd``` after that ```cd var\db```
step 7: removing ```rm .applesetupdone```
step 8: reboot ```reboot```
step 9: go through the macos setup. **your existing data is not erased** create an account with name admin and passwd admin123.
step 10: login with the username admin
step 11: go to settings and click users & groups. then click the "i" icon near your student account.
step 12: now allow the user to administer the computer. turn it on
step 13: shutdown your laptop and turn on
step 14 (optional): remove the admin account by doing step 11 but instead click the admin one. then delete user. delete home folder.
step 15: shutdown your laptop and turn on
step 16: make sure the admin account is gone and login to your student account.
